The provided code is a PHP script that uses the PHPMailer library to send an HTML email with a button to a recipient. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

    Include PHPMailer Libraries:

    php

require 'includes/PHPMailer.php';
require 'includes/SMTP.php';
require 'includes/Exception.php';

These lines include the necessary PHPMailer library files. PHPMailer is a popular PHP library for sending emails, and these files contain its core functionality.

Use PHPMailer Namespace:

php

use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;

use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\SMTP;

use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;


These use statements define namespaces for PHPMailer classes, making it easier to work with them in the script.

Create PHPMailer Instance:

php

$mail = new PHPMailer();

Here, you create an instance of the PHPMailer class, which will be used to configure and send the email.

SMTP Configuration:

php

$mail->isSMTP();

$mail->Host = "smtp.gmail.com";

$mail->SMTPAuth = true;

$mail->SMTPSecure = "tls";

$mail->Port = 587;

$mail->Username = "your_email";

$mail->Password = "your_password";


These lines configure the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) settings for sending the email. In this case, the script is set up to use Gmail's SMTP server. You specify the hostname, enable SMTP authentication, set the encryption type, port, and provide your Gmail username and password.

Email Sender and Recipient:

php

$mail->setFrom("senders_email", "Your Name");
$mail->addAddress("recipients_email", "Recipient Name");

These lines set the sender's email address and name (the "From" field) and the recipient's email address and name (the "To" field).

Email Subject:

php

$mail->Subject = "Test email using PHPMailer";

This line sets the subject of the email.

Create the Button HTML:

php

$button = '<a href="https://example.com" style="background-color: #007bff; color: #ffffff; padding: 10px 20px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 5px; font-weight: bold;">Get help from Bard</a>';

Here, you create an HTML anchor element (<a>) that represents the button. It includes an href attribute specifying the button's link and inline CSS styles for its appearance.

Set Email Body as HTML:

php

$mail->isHTML(true);

This line tells PHPMailer that the email body will contain HTML content.

Build the HTML Email Content:

php

$mail->Body = '
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>HTML Email with Button</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
        <p>This is a test email with a button:</p>
        ' . $button . '
    </body>
    </html>
';

Here, you construct the email body as an HTML document. It includes a title, a welcome message, a paragraph of text, and the button HTML that you created earlier.

Send the Email:

php

if ($mail->send()) { 
    echo "Email sent successfully!";
} else { 
    echo "Error: " . $mail->ErrorInfo; 
}

This code sends the email. If the email is sent successfully, it echoes "Email sent successfully!" to indicate success. If there's an error, it echoes the error message obtained from $mail->ErrorInfo.

Close SMTP Connection:

php

    $mail->smtpClose();

    Finally, this line closes the SMTP connection.

When you run this script, it will send an HTML email to the recipient's address with the specified subject, content (including the button), and sender information. The recipient will see the email in their inbox, and they can click the button to visit the link provided in the href attribute.
